**`Full-Stack Developer (Developer/Swimmer/Guitar player)`**

👨‍💻 I specialize in software development at a professional level. I have some projects that I have done and you can review them here. Both back-end and front-end.

🚀 Additionally, I have experience as founder and CEO of a start-up. This allowed me to develop skills such as: raising investment capital, leadership, management of high performance teams and design and development of new software products.

<summary><h3>👨‍💻 Mauro's Coding Journey</h3></summary
I think that I have always had a love for technology, since I was a child I have disassembled computers and electronic devices, although later I always had pieces left over.
I had my first computer when I was 9 years old. I learned the basics of MS-DOS to play and write stories. Due to things in life, I did not follow anything related to technology until 6 years ago when I started a start-up. I had the experience of creating a software product (a mobile app) from rough design to market release. It was a very hard path and in the end it didn't work out due to various situations, but the learning was incredible. It is for this reason that 2 years ago I resumed development to do what I like, which is creating things based on imagination, solving problems and the satisfaction of developing something from scratch.
Another of my passions is sports and music. You could say they are my trinity. I swim 4 times a week and on weekends I run 4 to 5 km. One of my dreams is to be able to do an ironman, so I'm training for it.
I also love playing the guitar, I don't really know much about music but I love learning any song that includes arpeggios. Most classical guitar.
Now my goals for 2023 is to contribute to open source projects, build some decentralized or open source project and be happy doing what I love ♥.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Forrest's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself iOS development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Java. A desire that landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation. However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - YouTube content creation. I eventually ended up quitting my software engineering job to pursue YouTube full-time, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route, a job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that it being a creator. And it worked out, but again, it became comfortable. It's easier to create a video than go out on a ledge and build my own product. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to streamline my YouTube content to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2023 due to the measure I'm putting in place now until the end of 2022. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.#
