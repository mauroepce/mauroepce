**`Full-Stack Developer (Developer/Swimmer/Guitar player)`**

👨‍💻 I specialize in software development at a professional level. I have some projects that I have done and you can review them here. Both back-end and front-end.

🚀 Additionally, I have experience as founder and CEO of a start-up. This allowed me to develop skills such as: raising investment capital, leadership, management of high performance teams and design and development of new software products.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Mauro's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I think that I have always had a love for technology, since I was a child I have disassembled computers and electronic devices, although later I always had pieces left over.
I had my first computer when I was 9 years old. I learned the basics of MS-DOS to play and write stories. Due to things in life, I did not follow anything related to technology until 6 years ago when I started a start-up. I had the experience of creating a software product (a mobile app) from rough design to market release. It was a very hard path and in the end it didn't work out due to various situations, but the learning was incredible. It is for this reason that 2 years ago I resumed development to do what I like, which is creating things based on imagination, solving problems and the satisfaction of developing something from scratch. <p></p>
-Another of my passions is sports and music. You could say they are my trinity. I swim 4 times a week and on weekends I run 4 to 5 km. One of my dreams is to be able to do an ironman, so I'm training for it.
-I also love playing the guitar, I don't really know much about music but I love learning any song that includes arpeggios. Most classical guitar.
-Now my goals for 2023 is to contribute to open source projects, build some decentralized or open source project and be happy doing what I love ♥
