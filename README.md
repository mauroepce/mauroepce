**`Full-Stack Developer (Developer/Swimmer/Guitar player)`**

👨‍💻 I specialize in software development at a professional level. I have some projects that I have done and you can review them here. Both back-end and front-end.

🚀 Additionally, I have experience as founder and CEO of a start-up. This allowed me to develop skills such as: raising investment capital, leadership, management of high performance teams and design and development of new software products.
